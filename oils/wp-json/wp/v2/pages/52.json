How do you know if the essential oils you\u2019re buying are worthy of being used by you and your family?<\/p>\n<p>If you want the best essential oils, find out if the company you plan to buy from takes the following precautions to ensure the quality of their oils:<\/p>\n\t<ul>\n<li>Sustainable and responsible sourcing (Where do their oils come from?)<\/li>\n<li>Extensive and thorough testing (Do they test their oils for adulteration and contamination?)<\/li>\n<li>Clear and accessible safety and usage information (Do they show customers how to use the oils safely?)<\/li>\n<li>Transparency (Do they use third-party testing? Do they make test results public?)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\t\t\t\t<img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/oilsnetwork.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/what-makes-doterra-different.png\" alt=\"what makes doterra different\" itemprop=\"image\" height=\"500\" width=\"500\" title=\"what-makes-doterra-different\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"  \/>\n<h2>\n\t\tWhat Makes doTERRA Different?\n\t<\/h2>\n\t<p>When you use a bottle of doTERRA essential oil, you\u2019re using an oil that is pure. There are no contaminants, fillers, or adulterations. The essential oil industry did not have standards to ensure purity, so doTERRA created one.<\/p>\n<p>Every batch of doTERRA essential oils goes through a rigorous testing process\u2014well beyond what would be considered \u201cgood enough.\u201d After that, each oil is sent to an independent third party for further testing and validation.<\/p>\n<h3>\n\t\tPure Essential Oils Pass Tests\n\t<\/h3>\n\t<p>If the oil passes the tests, it\u2019s labeled as CPTG Certified Pure Therapeutic Grade\u00ae. When you see the CPTG\u00ae label, you know you\u2019re using the purest essential oils on the market.<\/p>\n<p>Want to see the purity of doTERRA oils for yourself? Every single bottle of doTERRA oil comes with a quality ID. Use the ID number on the bottom of your bottle to view the third-party test results for that batch of oil by clicking below:<\/p>\n<h3>\n\t\tMore than Essential Oils \n\t<\/h3>\n\t<p>It\u2019s more than just testing that sets doTERRA essential oils apart. doTERRA works diligently to make a difference.
